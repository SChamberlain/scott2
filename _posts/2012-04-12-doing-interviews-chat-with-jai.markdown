From chat with Jai Ranganathan on doing in-person science interviews

+ Choosing space
	+ very quiet
	+ air ventilation very loud - be cognisant of
+ Set up/use a media space, talk to conference folks
+ Microphones, two ways to go
	+ setup that plugs in to the computer, a USB microphone, and record directly into [Audacity](http://audacity.sourceforge.net/).
		+ one mic $100 is a USB mic, and a plugin for another mic, brand: [here](http://www.amazon.com/Samson-Track-Microphone-Audio-Interface/dp/B0015MJE22)
		+ Not plugged in: solid state microphone - thumb drive in the microphone, some have a 2 channel setup
		+ loud computer, cold pack under computer to cool it down 
		+ audacity doesn't save, only saves when you are done.
	+ microphone not connected to computer, then download to computer later.
+ Perfect way to do it is do analog to digital conversion outside computer then pass to computer
	+ $1000 setup - 2 good condenser microphones that plug in to "Duet" hardware
		+ [Duet](http://new.apogeedigital.com/products/duet2.php) 
			+ microphones for these are regular with like 1/4 jacks. 
+ Anti-pop device: just screeen in front of microphone - look into, could build my own
+ He said max he could do is 4 in one day at a conference. 
+ Podcasts vs. YouTube
	+ podcasts are a niche group, but a fanatical group, so...
	+ podcasts
		+ need server space
		+ should be relatively easy
+ http://transom.org/?s=microphones
+ tips for voice
	+ to interviewee before it starts: "relax"
	+ have an arc of the conversation beforehand, then go over with them, and see if they are okay with it
	+ book to read
		+ [NPR guide](http://www.amazon.com/Sound-Reporting-Guide-Journalism-Production/dp/0226431789)
	+ keep your voice level, talk slowly very important - 2/3 normal rate.
+ get admin access to Journal of Ecology website somehow...?
