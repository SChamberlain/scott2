I'm trying to get some crowdfunding for my research on the evolution of native plants in agricultural landscapes. It's important to get a few bucks at the beginning so that the people that don't know me will chip in.  My campaign is part of a larger project by about 50 other scientists and me to see how well it works to go straight to the public to get funding for science research.  All these projects, including mine, are hosted at this site called RocketHub.  It is a site that hosts crowdfunding projects of all sorts - and now they have science.

The funding will go towards paying some students to collect data in the lab for me.
