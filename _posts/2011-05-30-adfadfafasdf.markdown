Inspired by <a href="http://www.carlboettiger.info/research/lab-notebook" target="_blank">Carl Boettiger's open lab notebook</a>, I am starting  to document my science on this site. As Carl states on his website, this is not really a blog per se, but a records of thoughts, etc., and I may or may not share useful information for others.
